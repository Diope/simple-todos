## Meteor To Do List

Learning Meteor as my JS stack of choice, well it's between this and node.js with Angular for the front end. I am finding Meteor to be way more...complicated for lack of a better word in regards to syntax and how you incorporate everything. Though I think that's because I'm not huge on Javascript let alone it's syntax.
